This folder contains an implementation of the Boltzmann learning algorithm to
parameterize hybrid DCA models. There are two main .c files:
- mcmc.c = regular implementation of the hybrid model
- mcmc_prof.c = implementation of the hybrid model for local data (accounting
  explicitly for the low number of mutations)

For the biophysical part, modify the makefile to include the path to the
viennaRNA library.

To compile this code use for the regular hybrid model
#+begin_src bash
make mcmc
#+end_src


To compile this code use for the low diversity hybrid model:
#+begin_src bash
make mcmc_prof
#+end_src
